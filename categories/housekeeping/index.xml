      <description>Now normally I would hire a professional(someone who does this for a living) as its more cheaper than paying my self on a per hour basis. But with this coronavirus spreading around in my area, the risk of having infected is greater than what I would be losing financially. I heard that you need at leask Php 500K to get treated.
Cleaning your AC unit should be done at once or twice a year specially if its used daily.</description>
