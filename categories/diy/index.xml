      <description>Now, normally I would hire a professional(someone who does this for a living) as it&amp;rsquo;s cheaper than paying my self on a per hour basis. But with this coronavirus spreading around in my area, the risk of having infected is greater than what I would be losing financially. I heard that you need at least Php 500K to get treated.
Cleaning your AC unit should be done at least once or twice a year specifically if it&amp;rsquo;s used daily.</description>
